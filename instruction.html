            You will see a solution's answer on the screen and all you have to do is find the sum that the computer is
            thinking of.
            <br><br>
            Your solution needs to have 6 characters and needs the answer to be the one on the top.
            <br><br>
            Once you have typed your solution then you need to press enter. The characters you have inputted will turn
            green, orange or gray.
            <br><br>
            If the character is gray then the character is not in the solution that game is thinking of.
            <br>
            If the character is orange then it is in the solution but not in the right place.
            <br>
            If the character is green then it is in the right place and is in the solution.
            <br><br>
            You have 6 tries to find the answer that the computer is thinking of and if you find the solution then you
            win. If you run out of tries then you lose.
